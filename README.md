Uncertainty in delta land area change on data in prior research are often missing or unclear. 
The multiple datasets have been correlated. The uncertainty of a selection of 54 deltas has been analyzed using a database made up off different databases. 
The absolute mean area change increases with delta size following a power function. 
The uncertainty in delta land area change linearly increases with an increase in delta land area change. 
The different research has been compared in a quantitative way and the research of Aqua is found to have the most accurate data compared to the average of the sources.
